# anagrammer
Explorations in anagram creation.

Goal
----
Find all of the anagrams in a dictionary in which there are at least 4 letters in the word and at least as many anagrams as there are letters.

The dictionary should be a file on disk with one line per word. 

Output should be in this format:

emit, item, mite, time  
merit, miter, mitre, remit, timer  
reins, resin, rinse, risen, serin, siren  
inert, inter, niter, retin, trine  
inset, neist, snite, stein, stine, tsine  

(Would also like to be able to submit a word and get back all anagrams.  Separate idea though.)
