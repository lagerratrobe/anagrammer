One way to approach the problem is to do the following

get a word
evaluate is word is at least 4 characters long
scramble the word (this is not trivial.  Permutation)

stackoverflow.com/questions/13109274/python-recursion-permutations

evaluate if scrambled form of word is the same as input
if not the same:
  check if scrambled form is in list
  scramble again (recursive scrambler)
  check again (until all forms are tested)
 
Take advantage of sorted list to look up possible match

Break the job up into multiple threads and split the list up into multiple jobs

If we've already found a match ie Reins = Resin, Rinse, Risen, Serin and Siren, none of those other words should get evaluated a second time.
